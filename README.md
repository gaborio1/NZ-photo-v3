SOURCES OF CODE I USED:

HOME PAGE PARALLAX: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt70Ld0dJCM&t=192s&ab_channel=DevEdDevEdVerified BY DEV ED

===== TODOS: =====

✅ animated search button/field
✅ portrait style modal has a fade in animation while landscape style has not!
✅ delete createdivs() from script.js as this is now done with portfolio.js
✅ ??? navbar/footer-content/logic.js ??? (content is done with: document.write)

===== BUGS: =====

parallax layers act funny when resizing browser window
title div moves away from position when resizing
✅ category img divs don't fit img height => messing with :hover
✅ "photography" animation not smooth enough, try without making container flexbox
✅ footer not visible when placed outside of .main-content div (temp fix: placed inside main content)

===== PROBLEMS: =====

✅ navbar.js does not include the navbar opacity scroll TIMELINE from parallax.js
✅ navbar opacity onscroll is only active on home page, trigger el: .image-container

UPDATES:
navbar, footer:
index,about,contact.html
index,about,slider,contact.css
navbar-content.js, navbar.css (for lightbox 2:1 test)
footer.js, footer.css (for lightbox 2:1 test)
