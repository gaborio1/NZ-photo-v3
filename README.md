todos:
    animated search button/field



bugs:
    parallax layers act funny when resizing browser window
    title div moves away from position when resizing 
    "photography" animation not smooth enough, try without making container flexbox
    footer not visible when placed outside of .main-content div (temp fix: absolute position)

problems:
    navbar.js does not include the navbar opnacity scroll TIMELINE from parallax.js
    navbar opacity onscroll is only active on home page, trigger el: .image-container
